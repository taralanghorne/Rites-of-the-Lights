# Rites-of-the-Lights 2D Unity Platformer RPG by Tara Lissa Langhorne
My senior project to earn my Bachelor of Arts in Digital Arts &amp; Sciences from the University of Florida's Digital Worlds Institute. This is a 2D Unity platformer RPG that presents an extraterrestrial fantasy adventure in which players control a young girl as she learns to control her new powers and soon finds herself at the center of a plot against the kingdom.
